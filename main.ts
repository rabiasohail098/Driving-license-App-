/*You are developing a simple program to help a user determine their eligibility for a
 driving license based on their age and whether they have completed a driver education 
 course. The eligibility criteria are as follows:

The minimum age to apply for a driving license is 16.
If the applicant is 16 or older and has completed a driver education course, they are 
eligible for a license.
If the applicant is 18 or older and has not completed a driver education course, they
are eligible for a license.
If the applicant does not meet any of the above criteria, they are not eligible for a 
license.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age and whether they have completed
a driver education course (yes or no). Based on the input, the program should output whether
the user is eligible for a driving license or not.
Your program should use if-else conditions to implement the eligibility criteria and handle
different cases appropriately. Ensure proper input validation and provide clear messages
indicating the user's eligibilityÂ status.*/
